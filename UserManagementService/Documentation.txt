Remarks :

1)Controller is unstructured due to not applying proper routing, route prefix, 
route constraint, route parameter.
2)There is no model validation(Data Annotation or Fluent Model Validation)
3)There is lack of join because atleast you need to have two tables for relationship.
Give proper demonstration(One to one or one to many).
4)Do write asynchronous programming by implementing Class, Async, Await.

Security :
5)Controller is insecure means there is no authentication, so we need to write logic 
for securing the Controller using custom middleware.
6)Need to handle runtime exception using try, throw, catch.
